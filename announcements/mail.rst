On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola vX.Y.Z.  It features some bugfixes and new
features.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.  It can
use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown â€” and can even turn
IPython Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual.  Nikola is flexible, and page builds are
extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has
been changed).
